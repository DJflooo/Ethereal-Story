    <main class="text-content">
        <p>
            As the sun was waking up, barely piercing heavy and grey clouds, a man was laying flat, his face in the sand. After a few minutes, his head went up, his eyes half-closed from the bursts of light around him. He was wearing rags, dirty and with sand all over them. As he stood up, still a bit wobbly, he asked himself: <i>*Where am I?*</i> But he quickly found a better question:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>*Wait, who am I? I can't... remember anything... How do I even know I don't know?*</i> Feeling the headache coming from a mile away, he quickly stopped thinking about it and instead looked around him. The rain was pouring on him, lightning striking the trees and the ground indiscriminately, the sun only slightly visible through the grey clouds. Then, he heard some walking not to far away. As he began walking towards there, he took some fruits from the ground. Not the prettiest ones, but better than nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            As he went up the hill, he saw a man standing just besides a simple grave. The man had mildly short black hair, and was only wearing rags too. The black haired man started talking as soon as he turned around, hearing the footsteps:
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"You're awake... I thought you'd be out for a few more days."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Who are you?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Huh, are you serious? The two of us barely got out of there alive, and now you have memory loss... I can't believe it..."</span> After a short pause, the man standing at the side of the grave continued. <span class="dialogue">"I'm going to assume you don't remember even our names. I'm <span class="neutral-name">Morden</span>, and you're <span class="neutral-name">Lucan Ether</span>."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>*<span class="neutral-name">Lucan Ether</span>*</i> thought <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span>, trying to remember it, to see if it really fit him. He said it to himself, but nothing really felt like 'home'. <span class="dialogue">"What happened to us?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"We were being held captive in a remote location,"</span> continued <span class="neutral-name">Morden</span>, <span class="dialogue">"and they performed magic experiments on us. We saw people die every day... but I guess you don't remember that. That's the reason of this grave too. <span class="neutral-name">Tucker</span> was his name."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"I'm so-"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"It's not your fault... we did everything we could. It's a shame that <span class="neutral-name">Tucker</span> couldn't make it, but at least he's had a proper burial."</span> <span class="neutral-name">Morden</span> cut in. <span class="dialogue">"Anyway, we're free now. You still remember how to use magic, right? Since we're magic-users, we'll make it far in this world, we just need to meet the right people."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Just as <span class="neutral-name">Morden</span> mentioned magic, <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span> felt something twist inside him, like it just... woke up? <span class="neutral-name">Morden</span> still had some things to say, postponing his thoughts on this feeling:
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"You can take one of the rowboats and go wherever you want."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"And what are you going to do?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"I'm going to stay here for a bit... I need to... to think some things over."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Where should I go?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"I don't know... you're hungry aren't you? Maybe you should go to <span class="location">Redwake</span>, it's a port to the east of here. They might have food for you, and being there may help you to remember some things from your past as well."</span> As <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span> was going back to the beach, <span class="neutral-name">Morden</span> added: <span class="dialogue">"Maybe we'll see each other again some day, <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span>. Until then, farewell, and I wish you good fortune."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            At the rowboat, <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span> found two... pieces of wood? A strange circular object with two triangles? He... didn't really understand what they were. Though, with the little forks on both sides of the rowboat, he guessed that the two wood pieces would fit there.
        </p>
        <p>
            But before trying anything, he wanted to focus on this.. thing... in his body. It was like some kind of... vapor. He simply thought about pushing it out of his hands, and out came a... kind of light? It wasn't pure light, but more... Hot? Like if it was some kind of red <span class="nova-plasma-magic">"fire-light"</span>. For now he still didn't know much, but seeing the small orb of <span class="nova-plasma-magic">"fire-light"</span> floating above his hand was pretty cool.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then he finally remembered he actually needed to get in the rowboat.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span> went in the rowboat, and suddently, muscle-memory kicked in. He took the two pieces of wood - that now he remembered were called oars - and put them in the 'forks' - or oarlocks. He sat down in the middle and started moving the oars in a circular motion... the wrong way. After he realized he wasn't going anywhere, he changed the direction of his movements, and finally sailed off of the tiny island. He then grabbed the other object - the circular one - and looked at it more thoroughly. It had four letters: N, S, W, E. He thought for a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>*<span class="neutral-name">Morden</span> asked me to go to the East. And I don't have any way to know where I go... So this must be what I need to use! And because East starts with an E, it should be there! But which of the triangles do I need to follow... Red or white?"</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            He finally decided on the white one, out of pure luck. As such, he started rowing in this direction. The waves were gentle, slightly pushing his rowboat upwards each time one passed. Well... until one that nearly made him lose the circular object. He could almost taste the sea's salt on his lips while he continued to think about himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>*<span class="neutral-name">Morden</span> talked about experiments, and people doing them on us. So I've been experimented on? Why? What did they do? And who are they? Maybe I should try to find the answers to those ques-*</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span>'s train of thought was cut short by the sighting of a big, dark figure under the sea, getting bigger and bigger, until finally, it jumped out of the water. The <span class="white-eyes">massive red shark</span> was already looking towards Lucan's rowboat with its <span class="white-eyes">glowing, white eyes</span>. It angled itself towards Lucan and started falling towards him.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span> rowed furiously to dodge the shark, barely avoiding it, the waves created almost sending him out of the tiny boat.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the <span class="white-eyes">monster</span> wasn't finished yet. It got back to the surface and quickly swam towards him, opening its jaws, one above it and one below the ship. But before it could close them...
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="impact">*Shlack!*</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            A harpoon pierced the side of the shark. Then a second, a third, a fourth... More than a dozen pierced its flanks while it slowly turned towards the attackers. But before it could completely turn around, a gigantic spear of fire emerged from a... weird and complicated circle, and went through the head of the <span class="white-eyes">behemoth</span>, killing it on the spot.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the shark was slowly sinking into the depths of the ocean, <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span> saw the ship behind it that saved him. It was quite a bit bigger that his, with two sails. The ship in itself was purple and yellow, and the sails beared a strange symbol: a... bulb... that seemed to emit light, with its outlines purple.
        </p>
        <p>
            The people on it were too concerned about reeling the big shark to even notice him. His curiosity got the better of him, making him row towards the boat full of strangers. He got closer to the side opposite to the one where people were reeling, while still remaining behind the corpse.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Well, I never thought we would find a <span class="white-eyes">White Eyes</span> here,"</span> said a <span class="lb-vice-cap">woman</span> voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"I found it, not 'we',"</span> said <span class="lb">another one</span>, playfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Yeah yeah, 'sorry, oh senser of shark'! Remind me who launched the final attack?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"I'm feeling like I'm getting attacked verbally..."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"And you are."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Hey! Can't you come help us?"</span> said a <span class="lb">male voice</span> on the other side.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Nah, too lazy."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Same."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Really?!"</span> said the <span class="lb">man</span> with indignation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Hey, I'm your <span class="lb-vice-cap">superior</span>, I do what I want."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Well the superio' bette' get her ass ove' he'e before I tell the higha'-ups."</span> said <span class="lb">another man</span>, approaching.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"The higher-ups don't care about you."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Are ya talkin' badly of the <span class="lightbringers">Lightbringers</span>?!"</span> said the <span class="lb">man</span> with false indignation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Oh no! What will I do? I should kill myself just for this!"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"... Wait, guys, I'm sensing something near the ship..."</span> said the <span class="lb">other woman</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Ya sure it's not the crew <span class="lb">Temia</span>?"</span> asked the <span class="lb">man</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Of course I am. I also know it's not <span class="white-eyes">White Eyes</span>, its dead. And it's not like a fish-"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"WAIT! Maybe it's an arcane fish!"</span> exclaimed the <span class="lb">man</span>, while running could be heard.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Tssk, of course it's not. <span class="lb-vice-cap">Riley</span>, you sense it too?"</span> asked <span class="lb">Temia</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"I just did... It seems humanoid. Wait, I'm seeing the tip of a boat behind the <span class="white-eyes">White Eyes</span>."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Really- oh yeah, I just saw it! HEY! IF YOU CAN HEAR US, SHOW YOURSELF!"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i><span class="dialogue">"You know, you don't need to say 'if you can hear us', because if they can't, they won't hear you say it..."</span></i> half-whispered <span class="lb-vice-cap">Riley</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span> slowly went out of his cover, which was still getting reeled by the crew. He could finally see the people that were talking: a tall white <span class="lb-vice-cap">woman</span> with a purple sweater, yellow armbands and brown pants, and the other, a slightly more tanned <span class="lb">woman</span>, wore a slightly dimmer yellow tank top and dark-purple shorts. They both had a small badge with the same logo as the one on the sails near their shoulders. Close to them was a <span class="lb">man</span> wearing a full purple-ish armor, with only his head visible. He put his hand on the hilt of his sword when he saw <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Hey there!"</span> said <span class="lb-vice-cap">Riley</span>, smiling. <span class="dialogue">"What are you doing around here?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"And who are you?"</span> asked <span class="lb">Temia</span> before <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span> could say anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"I... uh, I'm <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span>. I'm trying to get to <span class="location">Redwake</span>. I was told it was East from where I was..."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Then you are going the right wa-"</span> <span class="lb">Temia</span> couldn't finish her sentence before <span class="lb-vice-cap">Riley</span> punched the top of her head.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"It's the opposite way."</span> clarified <span class="lb-vice-cap">Riley</span>, <span class="lb">Temia</span> getting back up.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Oh, thanks. I wasn't really sure on how to use this."</span> said <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span>, showing his compass.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Well, the red arrow shows where you are goi-"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue"><b>"WHERE IS DA FISH?!"</b></span> said the <span class="lb">other man</span> that ran when an arcane fish was mentioned. He was a bit more... 'voluptuous' than the others.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"There are NO FISHES HERE!"</span> answered <span class="lb-vice-cap">Riley</span>, giving away another punch. <span class="dialogue">"Ugh, sorry about that. So yeah, the red arrow is where you're pointing at, while the white one is the opposite."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"How do you not know how to use a compass anyway?"</span> asked <span class="lb">Temia</span>, having regained her composure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Well... I just woke up, like, a few minutes ago, and I can't remember anything from before."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Hm, I see. I still sense magic in you though."</span> said <span class="lb">Temia</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Yeah, I can do this."</span> answered <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span>, a small orb of his <span class="nova-plasma-magic">fire-light</span> above his hand. <span class="dialogue">"I don't know what it is though..."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Hm..."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Yeah, not sure either..."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"So, really no fish here?"</span> asked the <span class="lb">man</span> that just got back up.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"NO, THERE ARE NO FISHES HERE, <span class="lb">GRAMIH</span>! Now go help the rest of the crew!"</span> said <span class="lb-vice-cap">Riley</span>, annoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Yeah, I don't recognize this one,"</span> said <span class="lb">Temia</span>, turning toward <span class="lb-vice-cap">Riley</span>, while <span class="lb">Gramih</span> was walking towards the rest of the crew, a sad look on his face. <span class="dialogue">"Do you?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Nah, me neither. <span class="lb">Bert</span>?"</span> she asked the <span class="lb">armored man</span> that stayed silent all throughout the conversation, despite the action.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"It's <span class="nova-plasma-magic">Plasma</span> magic. Not that rare, but not that common either,"</span> he said, no emotion in his voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>*<span class="nova-plasma-magic">Plasma</span>? What even is that?*</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Oooh, <span class="nova-plasma-magic">plasma</span>? Interesting."</span> <span class="lb-vice-cap">Riley</span> looked back to her crew, then back to <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span>. <span class="dialogue">"I think we're almost finished, and with your little rowboat, you shouldn't stay too long out in the sea. Go to <span class="location">Redwake</span>, they should have somewhere for you to sleep in. And if you see anyone like <span class="lightbringers">us</span>, you can be sure they won't attack you."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"And who are you really?"</span> asked <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"We are part of the <span class="lightbringers">Lightbringer</span>'s Fleet. And <span class="lb-vice-cap">Riley</span> here,"</span> said <span class="lb">Temia</span>, pointing at her, <span class="dialogue">"is one of the <span class="lb-vice-cap">Vice-Captains</span> of the Fleet. And an <span class="lb">Amber Lantern</span>, which is pretty high rank."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"While she only is a <span class="lb">Torch</span>-"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"I'm gonna blow you out of this carave-"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            And the two of them ran off, leaving only <span class="lb">Bert</span> with <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span>. The former talked first.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue">"Good luck to you. It must be pretty hard to live with memory loss. Just know the <span class="lightbringers">Lightbringers</span> are with you. For now,"</span> he said the last part almost like a warning, while <span class="neutral-name">Lucan</span> was sitting back in position to row, now reading his compass in the right way.
